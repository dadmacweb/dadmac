Club facilities include two cultivated grass strips, a special pad for helicopter operations and a private car park at our site on Carman Hill, which is situated on the Cardross Road, between Cardross and Renton. Over the last few years a programme of improvements has taken place, some which were funded by the National Lottery. This has resulted in one of the only model flying sites that is usable all year round. Flying is generally unrestricted as in accordance with club safety rules. Formal club days are held every Sunday and Wednesday evenings in the summer. Informal flying sessions are much in evidence at all other times, especially in good weather.

From the A82 (North or Southbound) take the turn off for Renton (B857). Turn right onto Renton Road (B857). After passing the Renton Garage, on your left, take the next left onto Cardross Road. After approx 1 mile you pass the reservoir and our flying site is located on the right. Parking is through the gate to the right of the Fishery hut.

The closest post code is G82 4PY which will take you to the east end of the reservoir.
