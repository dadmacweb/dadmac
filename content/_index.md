# Welcome

Welcome to the website of the Dumbarton & District Model Aircraft Club. We launched this site so that we can show you what we're all about and better illustrate what we get up to.

{{<picture src="/images/index.png" title="Field ready for flying">}}


We are based in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Our flying field is located on the Carman Moor between Cardross and Renton, just opposite the reservoir. To view a map on how to get to the site click here
Our club days are Sunday afternoons and Wednesday evenings in the summer but we have unlimited access to our site so there's usually some of us there all the time, especially when the weather's good.
New members are very welcome and there are always plenty of experienced pilots willing to teach you to fly. So if you're thinking of taking up the sport, why not come along and visit us? We're always there on club days, regardless of the weather.
In the meantime if you would like to know more about us or about model flying, getting started, where to go, what to buy etc., come up to the hill.
